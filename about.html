        <h1>About the 3D Cube Simulator</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>3D Cube Simulator</strong>, a web-based interactive puzzle designed for speedcubers and enthusiasts. Our goal is to provide a seamless, realistic, and accessible way to practice your solving skills directly in the browser.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>The interface is built for intuitive control, simulating the physical mechanics of a real cube:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rotate the View:</strong> Click and drag anywhere on the background to rotate the camera around the cube.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn Faces:</strong> Click and drag on any of the cube's faces to rotate that specific layer. The controls support intuitive mouse flicking.</li>
            <li><strong>Timer:</strong> The integrated centisecond timer allows you to track your solving speed accurately. It includes inspection time logic (manual start/stop).</li>
            <li><strong>Undo/Redo:</strong> Made a mistake? Use the history buttons to step back through your moves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The History of the Magic Cube</h2>
        <p>The Magic Cube (originally Bűvös kocka) was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture <strong>Ernő Rubik</strong>. Originally created to help his students understand 3D objects, the puzzle didn't become a global toy sensation until the 1980s.</p>
        <p>A standard 3x3x3 cube has six faces covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colors: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colors.</p>
        
        <h3>Mathematics of the Cube</h3>
        <p>The total number of permutations (arrangements) of a 3x3x3 cube is <strong>43,252,003,274,489,856,000</strong>. That's 43 quintillion! To put this into perspective, if you had as many standard-sized cubes as there are permutations, you could cover the Earth's surface 275 times.</p>
        <p>Despite this massive complexity, "God's Number"—the maximum number of moves required to solve any scramble configuration—is only <strong>20</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Speedcubing & Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Speedcubing is the sport of solving the cube as quickly as possible. The current world record for a single solve is under 4 seconds. Most advanced solvers use the <strong>CFOP</strong> method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cross:</strong> Form a cross on the bottom layer (usually white).</li>
            <li><strong>F2L (First Two Layers):</strong> Solve the first two layers by pairing corner and edge pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer):</strong> Orient all pieces on the top layer so the top face is a single color (usually yellow).</li>
            <li><strong>PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):</strong> Move the pieces on the top layer to their solved positions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This simulator is a perfect tool to practice these stages, test new algorithms, or simply relax with a casual solve.</p>

        <h2>Contact & Support</h2>
        <p>We are constantly improving the simulator. If you have feedback or feature requests, feel free to reach out.</p>
